CSE 331 Homework 9.

Name:  Ruiming Li

Changes that I made to the model:
    Used AndroidParser to parse data.
    Added a new method getCoordinate in CampusPathsModel.java.
    (It returns the corresponding coordinate of the given abbreviated building name.)

Extra features on campus paths GUI:
    The map will be automatically zoomed in when a route is drawn.
    The app allows the user to select the endpoints of a path by touching buildings on the map.
